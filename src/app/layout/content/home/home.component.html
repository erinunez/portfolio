    Hello! I'm Zaireen Akhzar, a front-end developer based in Sepang, Selangor. Over the past four years, I've been passionate about building, debugging, and maintaining websites that deliver exceptional user experiences. I've had the opportunity to work on various projects that have expanded my knowledge, including exciting ventures into GIS and Babylon 3D. I'm skilled in HTML, CSS, C#, JavaScript, and TypeScript, and I work with frameworks like Vue, Angular and .NET. I'm always eager to learn and grow in this ever-evolving field.
